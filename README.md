# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-System
A Machine Learning based program that predicts the prices of the houses in an area by using the prices of other houses with similar salient features.

# Process
* The goal is to predict the final Sale Price of the houses in the test data set.<br>
* Housing price is strongly based on factors such as location, features and facilities available.<br>
* The performances of various regression techniques such as Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, and Xtremme Gradient Boosting are compared.<br>
* Then the best fit model is chosen for achieving maximum accuracy.<br>
* This project explores the Housing dataset from Kaggle. <br>
* The dataset contains 79 variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.<br>
